To push a project to GitHub using Git Bash, follow these steps:

Initialize Git repository: If you haven't already, navigate to the root directory of your project and initialize a Git repository:

bash
Copy code
git init
Add files to the repository: Add all the files in your project to the staging area. You can use . to add all files or specify individual files or directories.

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit changes: Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message. This saves the changes in the local repository.

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a repository on GitHub: Go to GitHub (https://github.com/) and create a new repository for your project. Make sure to copy the repository URL.

Add remote repository: Add the remote repository (GitHub) as the origin. Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository_url>
Push to GitHub: Push the changes to the GitHub repository's main branch (e.g., master or main):

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
If you are using a different main branch (e.g., "main"), replace "master" with the appropriate branch name.

Provide credentials: Git will prompt you to enter your GitHub username and password (or personal access token) for authentication.

Check GitHub repository: Go to your GitHub repository page to verify that your code has been successfully pushed.

That's it! Your project should now be pushed to GitHub and visible on your repository page. For subsequent changes, you can use git add, git commit, and git push commands to update your repository.

Note: If your repository was already created on GitHub, you don't need to perform steps 4 and 5. Instead, you can directly clone the repository using git clone <repository_url> and then proceed with steps 2 to 8 to push your project.
