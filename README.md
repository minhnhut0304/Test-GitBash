He always wants to set foot in strange planets which have never been discovered by anyone.

But this time, on his current adventure to a strange and deserted planet, he has to face real trouble. The adventurer got lost and this planet is covered with traps and he cannot find any help. Your mission is to help the adventurer overcome dangerous obstacles on his way back to the spaceship in order to survive and continue writing his adventures.

## Resource references
Most of the basic techniques we have learned in CS427 3D Visualization and Game Development. <br />
[Youtube Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys) helped us a lot with the menu creation as well as the interaction and movement of the characters. <br />
Besides, we also used [Free Pixel Space Platform Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/free-pixel-space-platform-pack-146318#description) to make this world. <br />
